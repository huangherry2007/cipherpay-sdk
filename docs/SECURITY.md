# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices when using the CipherPay SDK in production applications.

## Key Management

### Private Keys
- Never store private keys in plain text
- Use secure key storage solutions (e.g., hardware wallets, secure enclaves)
- Implement proper key backup and recovery procedures
- Rotate keys periodically

### View Keys
- Keep view keys secure as they can reveal transaction details
- Implement proper access controls for view key usage
- Consider using different view keys for different purposes

## Note Management

### Note Storage
- Encrypt notes at rest using strong encryption
- Implement proper access controls for note storage
- Regularly backup notes securely
- Implement proper note synchronization with the blockchain

### Note Spending
- Implement proper checks to prevent double-spending
- Verify note ownership before spending
- Keep track of spent notes
- Implement proper error handling for failed transactions

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs

### Proof Generation
- Use secure random number generation for proof inputs
- Verify proof parameters before generation
- Implement proper error handling for proof generation failures
- Keep proof generation parameters secure

### Proof Verification
- Verify proofs before accepting transactions
- Implement proper error handling for proof verification failures
- Keep verification keys secure
- Regularly update verification keys

## Network Security

### RPC Endpoints
- Use secure RPC endpoints (HTTPS)
- Implement proper error handling for network failures
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Monitor RPC endpoint health

### Transaction Broadcasting
- Implement proper gas estimation
- Use secure transaction signing methods
- Implement proper error handling for failed transactions
- Monitor transaction status

## Application Security

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling for invalid inputs
- Sanitize user inputs before processing
- Implement proper logging for security events

### Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling throughout the application
- Log security-related errors
- Implement proper user feedback for errors
- Monitor error rates

### Logging
- Implement secure logging practices
- Never log sensitive information
- Implement proper log rotation
- Monitor logs for security events

## Testing

### Security Testing
- Implement regular security audits
