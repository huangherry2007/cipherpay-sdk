- Utilize standard Circom libraries such as `circomlib` for common components.
- Structure circuits with clear inputs, outputs, and constraints.
- Follow naming conventions: use camelCase for signals and PascalCase for component names.
- Include comments to explain complex constraints and logic.
- Ensure circuits are modular and reusable where possible.
